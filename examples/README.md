Examples
=======

This directory contains example `.py` files that can be used to get started with the KEMP Python API SDK. Each file contains variables that are required by the SDK. Make sure to fill these variables out when playing with the examples.


Note that these files are SDK examples and are not recommended for production deployments.


Check out this blogpost for more information on [getting started with the SDK](https://kemptechnologies.com/blog/getting-started-kemp-python-sdk/).
