This directory contains example `.py` files that can be used to get started with the KEMP Python API SDK. Each file contains the following variables that are required by the SDK:

```
LoadMaster_IP = " " # Your LoadMaster’s administrative IP 
# Note: To improve security, avoid using plaintext login and passwords and consider using environmental variables instead.  
LoadMaster_User = " " # Your LoadMaster’s Login User 
LoadMaster_Password = " " # Your LoadMaster’s User’s Password 
LoadMaster_Port = "443" # By default this is 443.  
```

In order to use these scripts, you must fill in the variables with the appropriate values.
